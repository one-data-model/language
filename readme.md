# Frozen, now outdated repository!

This repository was used to develop the Simple Definition Format (SDF)
for One Data Model definitions.
With the publication of SDF version 1.0, that development has now moved to:

https://github.com/one-data-model/sdf

The /language repository is an archive of what happened before that.

We do not want to "archive" it in the github sense because there are
still a number of issues with useful ideas in this repository that are
worth processing for extensions in future versions of SDF, "archiving"
would make these read-only.
