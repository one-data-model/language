# A Simple Definition Format for One Data Model definitions

## Introduction

The Simple Definition Format is a format for domain experts to use in the creation and maintenance of OneDM definitions.

OneDM tools convert this format to database formats and other serializations as needed.

This document describes definitions of OneDM Objects and their associated Events, Actions, Properties, and Data types.

The JSON format of an SDF definition is described in this document.

## Defined Terms

Note: Should we use RFC 2119?

Quality 
- a metadata item in a definition or declaration which says something about that definition or declaration. A quality is represented in SDF as a member in a JSON object that serves as a definition or declaration

Definition 
- Creates a new semantic term for use in SDF models and associates it with a set of qualities

Declaration
- A reference to and a use of a definition within an enclosing definition, intended to create component instances within that enclosing definition.

## Conventions

- The singular form is preferred for keywords.

## Example Definition:
```json
{
  "info": {
    "title": "Example file for ODM Simple JSON Definition Format",
    "version": "20190424",
    "copyright": "Copyright 2019 Example Corp. All rights reserved.",
    "license": "http://example.com/license"
  },
  "namespace": {
    "st": "http://example.com/capability/odm"
  },
  "defaultNamespace": "st",
  "odmObject": {
    "Switch": {
      "odmProperty": {
        "value": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": [
            "on",
            "off"
          ]
        }
      },
      "odmAction": {
        "on": {},
        "off": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## SDF structure

A SDF definition file has two sections, the information block and the definitions section.

### Information block
The information block contains generic meta data for the file itself and all included definitions.

The keyword that defines an information block is "info". It contains a set of key-value pairs that represent qualities that apply to the included definition.

Qualities of the information block are shown in the following table.

| Quality | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|title|string| yes|A short summary to be displayed in search results, etc.|
|version|string| yes|The incremental version of the definition, format TBD|
|copyright|string|yes|Link to text or embedded text containing a copyright notice|
|license|string|yes|Link to text or embedded text containing license terms|

### Definitions block

The Definitions block contains the namespace and default namespace declarations along with one or more type definitions according to the class name keywords for type definitions (object, thing, property, action, event, data, etc.).

The namespace declaration is a map containing one or more definitions of short names for URIs.

The defaultnamespace declaration defines one of the short names in the namespace map to be the default namespace.

| Quality | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|namespace|map|no|Defines short names mapped to namespace URIs, to be used as identifier prefixes|
|defaultnamespace|string|no|Identifies one of the prefixes in the namespace map to be used as a default in resolving identifiers|

The following example declares a set of namespaces and defines `st` as the default namespace.
```json
"namespace": {
  "st": "http://example.com/capability/odm",
  "zcl": "http://example.com/zcl/odm"
},
"defaultnamespace": "st",
```

Each class may have zero or more type definitions associated with it. Each defined identifier creates a new type and term in the target namespace, and has a scope of the current definition block.

A definition consists of a map entry using the newly defined term as a JSON key, with a value consisting of a map of Qualities and their values.

A definition may in turn contain other definitions. Each definition consists of the newly defined identifier and a set of key-value pairs that represent the defined qualities and contained type definitions.

For example, an Object definition looks like this:

```json
"odmObject": {
  "foo": {
    "odmProperty": {
      "bar": {
        "type": "boolean"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
An Object "foo" is defined in the default namespace, containing a property "foo.bar",  of type boolean.

## Identifier name resolution

### JSON Pointer and references to definitions
References in SDF are resolved using JSON Pointer. That is, every reference includes a JSON Pointer reference. 

The keyword "odmRef" is used in a definition to copy all of the qualities of the referenced definition, indicated by the included JSON pointer, into the newly formed definition. This is similar to the processing of the "$ref" keyword in JSON Schema.

For example, this reference :
```
"temperatureProperty": {
  "odmRef": "#/odmData/temperatureData"
}
```
Creates a new definition "temperatureProperty" that contains all of the qualities defined in the definition at /odmData/temperatureData.

If a JSON Pointer is used without the "odmRef" tag, it points to an SDF element. See the sections on "odmRequired" for an example.

### Namespace Prefix

Compact URI, or CURI, notation may be used to refer to definitions in another namespace. Names are resolved by expanding the prefix using the value for that prefix which is defined in the "namespace" section. For example, if a namespace prefix is defined:
```json
"namespace": {
  "foo": "https://example.com/#"
}
```
Then a reference to that namespace:
```json
"foo:odmData/temperatureData"
```
Would be expanded into:
```json
"https://example.com/#odmData/temperatureData"
```

### Target namespace

The target namespace is the namespace into which the defined terms are added. The target namespace is defined by the default namespace, or by an explicit prefix on the identifier using a colon ":".

For example if the default namespace in the example above is "foo", then you could use "temperatureData" to refer to the property defined at the URI:
```
https://example.com/#odmData/temperatureData
```

## Optionality using the keyword "odmRequired"

The keyword "odmRequired" is provided to apply a constraint for which definitions are mandatory in an instance conforming to a particular definition in which the constraint appears.

The value of "odmRequired" is an array JSON pointers, each indicating one mandatory definition.

``` json
{
  "odmObject": {
    "temperatureWithAlarm": {
      "odmRequired": [
        "0/odmData/temperatureData",
        "0/odmEvent/overTemperatureEvent"
      ],
      "odmData":{
        "temperatureData": {
          "type": "number"
        }
      },
      "odmEvent": {
        "overTemperatureEvent": {
          "outputData": {
            "alarmType": {
              "odmRef": "odm:/#odmData/alarmTypes/quantityAlarms",
              "const": { "OverTemperature": 3774 }
            },
            "temperature": {
              "odmRef": "4/odmData/temperatureData"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above example uses [Relative JSON Pointer][] syntax to point to nearby definitions. 

The prefix of a relative JSON pointer indicates how many levels above the parent element of the JSON Pointer the following path string is relative to.

In this section, the pointer prefix "0" indicates that the following path is relative to the parent element "temperatureWithAlarm". 

```json
    "temperatureWithAlarm": {
      "odmRequired": [
        "0/odmData/temperatureData",
        "0/odmEvent/overTemperatureEvent"
      ],
    }
```

In this section, the pointer prefix of "4" indicates that the following path is relative to the element four levels above the parent element, in this example pointing to the element at the document-relative path "#/odmObject/temperatureWithAlarm/odmData/temperatureData". 

```json
            "temperature": {
              "odmRref": "4/odmData/temperatureData"
            }
```

## Example Simple Object Definition:
```json
{
  "info": {
    "title": "Example file for ODM Simple JSON Definition Format",
    "version": "20190424",
    "copyright": "Copyright 2019 Example Corp. All rights reserved.",
    "license": "http://example.com/license"
  },
  "namespace": {
    "st": "http://example.com/capability/odm"
  },
  "defaultNamespace": "st",
  "odmObject": {
    "Switch": {
      "odmProperty": {
        "value": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": [
            "on",
            "off"
          ]
        }
      },
      "odmAction": {
        "on": {},
        "off": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## High Level Composition

The requirements for high level composition include the following:

- The ability to represent products, standardized product types, and modular products while maintaining the atomicity of Objects.

- The ability to compose a reusable definition block from objects, for example a single plug unit of an outlet strip with on/off control, energy monitor, and optional dimmer objects, while retaining the atomicity of the individual objects.

- The ability to compose objects and other definition blocks into a higher level thing that represents a product, while retaining the atomicity of objects.

- The ability to enrich and refine a base definition to have product-specific qualities and quality values, e.g. unit, range, and scale settings.

- The ability to reference items in one part of a complex definition from another part of the same definition, for example to summarize the energy readings from all plugs in an outlet strip.

### Paths in the model namespaces

The model namespace is organized according to terms that are defined in the definition files that are present in the namespace. For example, definitions that originate from an organization or vendor are expected to be in a namespace that is specific to that organization or vendor. There is expecred to be an ODM namespace for common ODM definitions.

The structure of a path in a namespace is defined by the JSON Pointers to the definitions in the files in that namespace. For example, if there is a file defining an object "Switch" with an action "on", then the reference to the action would be "ns:/odmObject/Switch/odmAction/on" where ns is the short name for the namespace prefix.

### Modular Composition
Modular composition of definitions enables an existing definition (could be in the same file or another file) to become part of a new definition by including a reference to the existing definition within the model namespace. 

#### Use of the "odmRef" keyword to re-use a definition
An existing definition may be used as a template for a new definition, that is, a new definition is created in the target namespace which uses the defined qualities of some existing definition. This pattern will use the keyword "odmRef" as a quality of a new definition with a value consisting of a reference to the existing definition that is to be used as a template. Optionally, new qualities may be added and values of optional qualities and quality values may be defined.

#### The "odmComponent" keyword
One or more existing definition may be used, with its name and its path in the model namespace, as virtual element in a new definition. This has the effect of linking to an instance when the model is deployed as run time. This pattern is useful to link properties, actions, and events from one object to another object, or to link objects together in a complex thing definition. This, along with the odmView class, supports modeling of the OCF "interface type" feature denoted by the "if" query parameter.

### odmView
The odmView element provides a composed type that defines a named view, and which uses the odmComponent keyword to populate the view with one or more instances of odmThing, odmObject, odmProperty, odmEvent, or odmAction. 

- Qualities of odmView

| Quality | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|name|string|no|human readable name|
|description|string|no|human readable description|
|title|string|no|human readable title to display|
|$comment|string|no|explanatory comments | N/A |
|odmRequired|array|no|Array of JSON Pointers to mandatory items in a valid definition | N/A |
|odmComponent|array|no|Array of JSON Pointers to definitions to be included|N/A|


odmView may contain references to the following ODM types:

- odmThing
- odmObject
- odmProperty
- odmAction
- odmEvent


### odmThing

An odmThing is a set of declarations and qualities that may be part of a more complex model. For example, the object declarations that make up the definition of a single socket of an outlet strip could be encapsulated in an odmThing, and the socket-thing itself could be used in a declaration in the odmThing definition for the outlet strip.

odmThing definitions carry semantic meaning, such as a defined refrigerator compartment and a defined freezer compartment, making up a combination referigerator-freezer product.

An odmThing may be composed of odmObjects and other odmThings.

|description|string|no|human readable description|
|title|string|no|human readable title to display|

|odmRequired|array|no|Array of JSON Pointers to mandatory items in a valid definition | N/A |
|odmComponent|array|no|Array of JSON Pointers to definitions to be included|N/A|
|odmRef|object|no|reference to a definition to be used as a template for a new definition|

odmThing may define or include the following ODM types:

- odmView
- odmThing
- odmObject

### odmProduct

An odmProduct provides the level of abstraction for representing a unique product or a profile for a standardized type of product, for example a "device type" definition with required minimum functionality.

Products may be composed of Objects and Things at the high level, and may include their own definitions of Properties, Actions, and Events that can be used to extend or complete the included Object definitions.

Product definitions may set optional defaults and constant values for specific use cases, for example units, range, and scale settings for properties, or available parameters for Actions.
